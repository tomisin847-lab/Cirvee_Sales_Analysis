# Customer Segmentation & Behavior Analysis (Excel)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchase data to understand customer behavior,
identify high-value customers, and segment customers based on spending and
purchase frequency.

The goal is to provide actionable insights that a business can use to improve
customer retention and revenue.

---

## Business Questions
- Who are the best customers?
- How often do customers purchase?
- Which customers are loyal vs one-time buyers?
- Which customer segments generate the most revenue?

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer purchase records including:
- Customer ID
- Order ID
- Order Date
- Product
- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Total Amount

The raw data was messy and required cleaning before analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process
The following steps were performed in Excel:

1. Converted raw data into Excel Tables
2. Trimmed text columns to remove extra spaces
3. Standardized mixed date formats
4. Handled missing quantities by assuming 1 unit
5. Recalculated total sales to ensure accuracy
6. Created helper columns (Month, Year)
7. Removed errors and validated values
